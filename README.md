# Q Applet: Pomodoro Max

Stay productive with a fully customizable work/break timer inspired by the Pomodoro technique, running right on your Das Keyboard Q.
The applet gradually colors a bar of keys to visualize time passing, with color-coded lighting indicating whether it’s focus time or break time.

## ⏱ Applet Behavior

- User chooses two colors: one for work and one for break
- A bar fills progressively to show the cycle’s progress
- Automatically alternates between work and break periods
- Keeps time between polls, your cycle won’t reset or drift
